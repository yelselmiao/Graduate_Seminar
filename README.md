# *MSc Graduate Seminar*

- **Time**: Thu, 2022-04-28 16:30  
- **Title**: *Data Analytics in Healthcare*  
- **Abstract**: The healthcare industry collects vast amounts of health data. Analysis of these data informs important decisions related to healthcare delivery, evaluation, and quality management. For the past 12 months, Shuyi has been working as a business analyst at Fraser Health Authority focusing on process improvement and data analysis. She would like to talk about her experience working with healthcare data in terms of data acquisition, data mining, insight extraction, and potential challenges. Since the data-related inquiries from clinical specialists will be quite different from those from an academic setting, examples would be provided to give some insights into how to approach these real-world questions.
